		"It is not the critic who counts;nottheman whopoints out how the strong manstumbles, or where the doer ofdeeds couldhave done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comees short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotion; who spends himselff in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triump of high acheivement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls whoo neither know victory nor dedfeat."
